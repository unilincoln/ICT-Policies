Introduction

Purpose of Policy
-----------------

This document defines the University of Lincoln’s Information Systems Acceptable Use Policy for Information and Communication Technology (ICT) Resources.

The ICT Resources provided for academic purposes and University business are extremely valuable assets which are relied upon for the delivery of University service.

This policy is designed to support all areas of the University’s business and to recognise academic freedoms when using ICT Resources.

The intention is that this policy will enable the University to carry out its activities, by protecting and preserving University ICT Resources at the appropriate level.

The policy is intended to protect the ICT assets of the University by adopting the core principles of information security:

Confidentiality:
    The prevention of unauthorised disclosure of information;

Integrity:
    The prevention of corruption or unauthorised amendment or deletion of information;

Availability:
    The prevention of unauthorised withholding of information or resources.

This policy has been subjected to an Equality Impact Assessment. During the screening process it was judged to not to disproportionally affect any equality group. This is because the policy defines a protocol for everybody which outlines behaviour when using ICT Resources. Therefore no further Equality Impact Assessment process is required.

Policy Objectives
-----------------

The objectives of the policy are:

* To ensure users have proper awareness and concern for the security of ICT Resources and adequate appreciation of their responsibilities during its use;
* To provide guidance for the acceptable use of ICT Resources;
* To ensure that users are aware of their legal obligations when using ICT Resources;
* To ensure users are aware of their accountability and aware that failure to abide by this policy is a disciplinary matter which may have serious consequences under the terms of University Regulations, Contracts of Employment or other contracts or agreements. Ultimately, this could result in summary expulsion, dismissal or cancellation of contract or agreements.

Help with this Policy
---------------------

Guidance and clarification about the interpretation or any other aspect of this policy is available through the ICT Service Desk that can be contacted on 01522 886500 or helpdesk@lincoln.ac.uk.

If you feel that your particular requirements for use of ICT Resources have not been properly addressed by this policy please contact the ICT Service Desk on 01522 886500. When difficult issues arise, particularly with academic requirements, they may be referred to the appropriate University ethics committee.

---------
Email Use
---------

Introduction
------------

The University promotes and encourages the use of email as an important means of communication and to provide an efficient method of conducting the University’s business. However, misuse of this facility can have a negative impact upon the work and reputation of the University.

Users may be given access to University email systems for the conduct of University-related business. The use of email facilities is subject to this policy as well as all relevant laws and other University Policies and Regulations.

Although most people use email for University business, reasonable and sensible personal use of email is permitted as long as it does not disrupt or distract the user from the conduct of University business (e.g. due to volume, frequency or time expended).

Similarly personal use of email should not restrict the use of email by other legitimate users. Care should be taken to ensure that email is addressed to the correct business or personal recipient. If you receive an email for which you are not the intended recipient please notify the sender immediately and remove it from your system. Do not disclose the contents to another person or take copies.

The contents of personal emails are private and their contents are not investigated or monitored except in the limited and exceptional circumstances set out in section 9.2. It is recommended that personal email be marked personal in the subject line and stored in a separate folder.

The nature of the Internet means that email is inherently insecure and users should assume that email information is not secure or protected while in transit (unless it is encrypted using an appropriate method).

The University provides anti-virus and spam (unsolicited email) filtering services as a matter of course to users of the email service. Whilst efforts are made to keep these filtering services effective and up-to-date, the University can provide no guarantee that they will be effective against all viruses or spam.

Under some limited circumstances the University may access and disclose the contents of email messages in accordance with its legal and audit obligations and for legitimate operational purposes. See section 9 for more information.

Email Usage
-----------

The University’s email resources must not be used for:

#. Distributing or storing images, text or materials that are, or might be considered as, illegal, paedophilic or defamatory.
#. Distributing or storing images, text or materials that are, or might be considered as, indecent, obscene, pornographic or of a terrorist nature unless you have a legitimate reason for doing so and have written authorisation from your academic supervisor or head of department.
#. Distributing or storing images, text or materials that are, or might be considered as, discriminatory, offensive, abusive, sexist or racist when the context is a personal attack or might be considered as harassment.
#. Knowingly introducing malicious software, such as a virus or similar threat, into the University ICT Resources or the ICT Resources of any other person or organisation.
#. Sending or deliberately receiving Credit or Debit Card numbers (see 3.1.9 for definition). If you do receive an email containing a Credit or Debit card number you must delete it immediately.
#. Sending emails that are unrelated to the business of the University (except for limited personal use mentioned in the introduction above) or for personal gain.
#. Sending commercial material or software or any copyrighted material belonging to parties outside of the University, or belonging to the University itself, without legitimate permission from the owner.
#. Sending unsolicited email ("spam"), chain letters or any form of unauthorised or unsolicited content using University email resources.
#. Sending unsolicited email ("spam") to a large number of recipients without authorisation e.g. sending to email groups, such as faculties or departments that the sender is not a member of, or sending to all students or all staff. (Contact the Communications Department or ICT to send to all staff or all students or to use the "Daily Alert" service for this type of communication.)
#. Impersonate or otherwise disguise identity ("spoof") when using University email resources.
#. When sending Personal or Confidential information (see 3.1.10 for definition) by email externally (i.e. not to an address with a "@lincoln.ac.uk" suffix) you must have authorisation from your supervisor or line manager and it must be strongly encrypted (the ICT Service Desk on 01522 886500 or helpdesk@lincoln.ac.uk can advise on this). The password must be transmitted to the recipient by an alternative method (e.g. by telephone).
#. Sending Personal or Confidential information (see 3.1.10 for definition) without properly assessing the risks involved.
#. If the information is sent externally (see 4.2.11 above), relates to many individuals or contains Sensitive Personal information or is sent to many people then it must be encrypted. The encryption password must be transmitted to the email recipient by an alternative method (e.g. by telephone). The ICT Service Desk on 01522 886500 or helpdesk@lincoln.ac.uk can advise on this.

------------------------------------------
Software, Services - Applications and Data
------------------------------------------

Introduction
------------

The University provides software, applications and services through a variety of delivery platforms enabling users to carry out the business of the University.

Users are required to ensure that they have appropriate authorisation when using any software, service, application or data.

Users are permitted to use applications or services only within the provisions of applicable licensing agreements and copyright obligations.

The University requires that only authorised software, services, applications or data are used with its ICT Resources. Users should not use or install unlicensed software including, but not limited to, applications, utilities, services or leisure software (e.g. music, films, games) on ICT Resources.

---------------------
Internet and Networks
---------------------

Introduction
------------

The University promotes and encourages the use of the Internet, including applications such as Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and blogs, as an important means of communication. However, misuse of these facilities can have a negative impact upon the work and reputation of the University.

Users may access Internet facilities for the conduct of University related business. The use of the Internet is subject to this policy as well as all relevant laws and other University Policies and Regulations.

Users should be aware of the difficulties of taking appropriate care of their own and other peoples Personal or Confidential information when using the Internet. In some situations information may inadvertently or unintentionally become public.

Although most people use the Internet for University business, reasonable and sensible personal use of the Internet is permitted as long as it does not disrupt or distract the user from the conduct of University business (e.g. due to volume, frequency or time expended) or restrict the use of resources to other legitimate users.

The provision of Internet material via computer networks to users is controlled and monitored (as set out in section 9.2) in line with the goals and objectives of the University.

The University Internet connection is provided by JANET which connects the UK’s education and research organisations to each other, as well as to the rest of the world through links to the global Internet. JANET and this policy require that users abide by the prevailing `JANET Acceptable Use Policy`_.

.. _`JANET Acceptable Use Policy`: http://www.ja.net/company/policies/aup.html

#. View, make, publish or post images, text or material that contravene University Regulations or brings, or may bring, the University into disrepute.
#. Upload, download, link, embed or otherwise transmit commercial software or any copyrighted materials without permission unless this is covered or permitted under a commercial, licence or other such agreement. 
#. Download any software, data or other material without implementing effective virus protection measures.  The University provides virus protection software to authorised users free of charge (contact the ICT Service Desk on 01522 886500 or helpdesk@lincoln.ac.uk for more information).
#. Intentionally interfere with the normal operation of the network, including the propagation of computer viruses or sustained high volume network traffic that substantially hinders others in their use of the network.
#. Monitor network traffic or contents, or scan devices connected to the network without written authorisation from the Head of ICT Services.
#. Upload to the Internet or 'cloud' based storage (e.g. Dropbox) Personal or Confidential information without authorisation from your supervisor or line manager AND without ensuring it is strongly encrypted (the ICT Service Desk on 01522 886500 or helpdesk@lincoln.ac.uk can advise on this).

----------------------------------------------
Mobiles, Laptops, Tablets and Portable Storage
----------------------------------------------

Introduction
------------

The University recognises that portable devices play an ever increasing role in day to day business activities. Portable devices require increased levels of awareness because they are so convenient to use.

These devices include laptops, mobile (smart) phones, tablets, iPods, PDAs, memory sticks and cards, CDs, DVDs, Blu-ray Discs and other types of storage media available or become available in the future.

**Note:** University staff using laptops, memory sticks, tablets or other portable media or devices to store Personal or Confidential data (see section 3.1.10 for definition) MUST ensure they are strongly encrypted. See section 7.2.3 below for full details.

Use of Mobiles, Laptops, Tablets and Portable Storage
-----------------------------------------------------

#. Under this policy users of ICT Resources must scan any storage device connected to a University ICT resource with virus protection software before or immediately following connection. Users can contact the ICT Service Desk (01522 886500) for more information about how to do this.
#. Under this policy, users of portable devices (including all the devices mentioned in section 7 introduction) must never, under any circumstances, store or save Credit or Debit card numbers (see section 3.1.9 for definition) on this equipment.
#. The copying of data to portable storage (including all the devices mentioned in section 7 introduction) is governed by different rules according to the sensitivity of the data defined by the UK Data Protection Act (1998), other legislation and government guidelines.

   These definitions are:

   a. Personal or Confidential data as defined in section 3.1.10.

      Data falling into the "Personal or Confidential Data" category must never be copied to portable storage under any circumstances except when ALL of the following requirements have been met:

      * Copying Personal data has been authorised by the University Information Compliance Manager.
      * Copying the data has been authorised by your line or service manager/supervisor.
      * It has been encrypted using strong encryption (the ICT Service Desk, 01522 886500, can advise on this)

      Data falling into the "Other Sensitive Data" category must never be copied to portable storage under any circumstances except when ALL of the following requirements have been met:

      * Copying the data has been authorised by your line or service manager/supervisor.
      * It has been encrypted using strong encryption (the ICT Service Desk, 01522 886500, can advise on this)

#. When sending any media or storage device containing sensitive data by post or courier a tracked method must be used, in addition to the requirement to be strongly encrypted. The encryption password must be transmitted to the recipient by an alternative method (e.g. telephone).
#. Email on portable devices, in particular mobile phones is frequently not secure. When accessing University email on portable devices users should ensure that emails and attachments are protected by a password. Emails containing Personal or Confidential data must be encrypted during transmission and storage (see 7.2.3 above). Please contact the ICT Service Desk on 01522 886500 or helpdesk@lincoln.ac.uk for more information.

---------------------
Remote Access Working
---------------------

Introduction
------------

The use of ICT Resources from remote locations has become more practical as technology has advanced. Where appropriate the University seeks to support authorised users when accessing ICT Resources from remote locations.

If ICT Resources are used from a remote location where a stricter security or remote access policy provision applies, the stricter policy provision will apply.

Remote Access Usage
-------------------

Under this policy users of ICT Resources must:

#. Ensure they have a legitimate need in terms of University business for remote access working.
#. Obtain proper authorisation from your line or service manager/supervisor for allowing remote access working.
#. Only use the ICT supplied access mechanisms and connection details from ICT Services when remote access working.
#. Agree when using Remote Access using personal equipment (e.g. your own PC) from a remote location, it is used as though it is covered by this policy in all respects.
#. Avoid using remote access working from public systems, such as Internet cafes (information, e.g. passwords, might be retained and therefore useable by others).
#. Ensure that when using remote access working - it is not possible for other people to observe the screen.
#. Take appropriate care of Personal or Confidential data by ensuring the data is properly protected in, and to and from, the remote environment. This means encrypting the personal or sensitive data using strong encryption. This could by using a Virtual Private Network (VPN), an encrypted email connection (e.g. https://email.lincoln.ac.uk) and file based encryption. Please contact the ICT Service Desk on 01522 886500 or helpdesk@lincoln.ac.uk for more information.
#. Take appropriate care of Personal or Confidential data by ensuring the data is properly protected when using unsecured wireless connections or unsecured transfer methods (e.g. FTP or unsecured HTTP) in a remote environment. This means encrypting the Personal or Confidential data using strong encryption. This could by using a Virtual Private Network (VPN), an encrypted email connection (e.g. https://email.lincoln.ac.uk) and file based encryption. Please contact the ICT Service Desk on 01522 886500 or helpdesk@lincoln.ac.uk for more information.

This list is not intended to be exhaustive. Details about legislation can be obtained from the `Office of Public Sector Information`_.

.. _`Office of Public Sector Information`: http://www.opsi.gov.uk/

Email Access, Investigation and Monitoring Provisions
-----------------------------------------------------

For staff accounts, and because email is provided primarily for business and academic use, it might be necessary to allow another staff member access to an individual user’s accounts for important business purposes (for example, to access time sensitive information when an individual user is on long term absence or is otherwise unavailable).  It is recommended that personal emails are clearly marked as such or stored in a personal folder, so that access to them can be avoided should business access be needed.  Where possible, an individual’s permission should be sought before allowing access to another staff member.

Normally, ICT infrastructure is only monitored to ensure its efficient and effective operation.  This routine performance monitoring does not require content of shared drives or email to be accessed or read, but may involve identifying an ICT user to allow their computer to be fixed or to remove a virus.

However, the University keeps back-ups of information which might subsequently be accessed as part of a properly authorised investigation in accordance with the provisions of English law.

Authorisation for an investigation or monitoring will be sought after a complaint has been received about suspected violations of this or other University policies or regulations or as part of a wider investigation, including allegations of illegal activity.

Examples might include an investigation or monitoring in response to complaints involving cyber bullying or provision of user account information or activity in support of a wider investigation into criminal activity.

Any investigation or monitoring is subject to the following safeguards:

* The investigation or monitoring will be authorised by a senior member of University Staff of at least Pro-Vice Chancellor level;
* The monitoring or investigation will only take place when the authorising senior member of University Staff is satisfied there are grounds for suspecting criminal activity or serious malpractice;
* The investigation or monitoring will be carried out by technically competent staff with appropriate training;
* Records will be kept about what was accessed, when and by whom.

Under normal circumstances the individual(s) concerned will be notified in advance, unless, in the opinion of the authoriser, the notification would make it difficult to prevent or detect wrongdoing.

Statistics and data relating to the use of University ICT Resources may be made available to third parties, such as the police, in accordance with English law. This may occur when a lawful request for this information is received or when the University is legally obliged to, or it is appropriate to do so for other reasons.

The University also reserves the right to demand that passwords and decryption keys, where used, be made available, so that it is able to fulfil its right of access to material when a lawful request for this information is received or when the University is legally obliged to.
